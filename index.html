								<h2 class="major">Journey</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/headshot.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Programming had never been a dream of mine growing up.  Like most people, I had wanted to be many different things at different times. However, one path always remained in mind and that was to be a teacher.  So I embarked on that journey which found me inside various classrooms not only helping students with disabilities learn, but also myself learning about how to be an educator myself.</p>
								<p>Cue dramatic music. Enter pandemic stage left. Like many, the road I was on was upended and I found myself searching for an alternate career.  After hearing about the success of others who pursued programming, I started learning a bit of Python on my own.  Truthfully, coding was a bit of an enigma to me at first; forcing me to develop ways of thinking that were out of my comfort zone.  However, after experiencing the wonders of watching bits of code that I wrote work to provide the desired output, I knew myself well enough to know that I needed a classroom and instructors to optimize my learning in this new area. </p>
								<p>About six months later I found myself at the end of an arduous bootcamp, able to call myself a software engineer.  I've had the pleasure working with some incredible individuals on the same journey as me and I have gained the knowledge and skills to create in a way I had never dreamed of.  However, my passion for education remains.  With all that I have gained, I desire to give back all the more.  Whether it be as an educator myself, teaching others the magic in the discovery of coding or as colleagues on the job, sharpening each other through collaboration; I look forward to see where this newfound adventure takes me.</p>
								<p>If you stuck around or simply skipped to the end, I'd love it if you check out what I've <a href="#projects">created</a> so far and <a href="#contact">connect</a> with me. </p>
								<p>Thanks! I wish you the best if all your journeys as well</p>
